This project focuses on predicting Airbnb listing prices in New York City using the 2019 AB\_NYC\_2019 dataset. The main goal was to build an accurate and efficient regression model. The dataset was cleaned and simplified by removing unnecessary columns such as `id`, `name`, `host_id`, `host_name`, `last_review`, `latitude`, and `longitude`—these either contained high-cardinality text, identifiers not useful for learning, or were replaced with more meaningful engineered features. For instance, rather than using raw geolocation, a structured hierarchical encoding system was created using `city_code` and `location_code`. `city_code` was generated by label-encoding the `neighbourhood_group` and multiplying by 10 to provide space for distinct subregions. Then, for each unique `city_code`, the `neighbourhood` values were label-encoded separately, and added to their corresponding city group to form a unique `location_code`. This approach captured geographic information in a compact, learnable format. The data was also preprocessed by filling missing values (like `reviews_per_month` with 0), transforming dates into a numeric feature (`days_since_review`), and filtering out extreme values (prices above \$500, or stays longer than 30 nights). The model architecture included a lightweight neural network with dense layers and dropout for regularization. The features were normalized and categorical values one-hot encoded through a pipeline using `ColumnTransformer`. The target variable (`price`) was log-transformed using `log1p` to reduce skewness and improve learning behavior. The final model was trained with early stopping and validation split, and achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of **\$3.64** and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of **\$5.74**, indicating very high accuracy. Sample predictions include prices like actual: \$325 → predicted: \$331.39, actual: \$70 → predicted: \$70.49, and so on. This demonstrates that the model not only generalizes well but also provides precise real-world value predictions within a very narrow error margin.
